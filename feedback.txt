Overall, you implemented a non-trivial game. The final result has most 
of the core visual components, UI, and game play logic. Good job!
Obviously adding real multiplayer would be a good addition, but having 
the full game logic in a single application is still a great 
achievement for 4 weeks (in which you were not working full-time on it)
The final tiles and cards look great, as does the placement of the middle numbers.
Consider compiling your program for webgl and hosting it form github.

Your project management was great throughout. It is unfortunate that not all 
team members could contribute equally throughout the semester -- the end result 
might have been really good otherwise. It is still quite good though. A strong 
start. I also respect that you had to figure out for yourselves how to program 
the game in Unity. If you chose a standard game type, there are numerous 
tutorials to use a starting point.

Some suggestions for improvements:
- Need some big text to show whose turn it is
- Error messages could pop up when the player tries to do something illegal. 
The log is great but users will understand context-specific messages better.
- I had trouble keeping track of which color belonged to which player
- The robber got stuck on a road and I couldn't move it
- Would be nice to let the user change their minds on a placement before 
they click EndTurn

Based on evaluations and git history, all team members contributed 
a non-trivial amount. However, Matt and Mirayda contributed much more
and Mirayda gets the bragging rights for author of the year. See 
stats/authors.html for details.

I could not find documentation on your final architecture, such as TurnLog. It 
looks like you didn't use classes for Road, Settlement, etc -- which is fine -- 
but I want to see a high-level description of how your final application 
is implemented. 

(32/35 points) Source code: A

-1 Would be helpful to know what scene to open in Unity
-1 Similarly instructions on how to build and run the tests
-1 It is customary to include the url and command for downloading the source

(13/15 points) Test code: A

-1 Would like to see documentation about your test scenes
-1 You did not check in you sln/csproj files to git!
