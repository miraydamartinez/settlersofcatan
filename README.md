# Settlers of Catan

To view project information: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KeTh3wMNB9Z8lN_v3HMLbHeKCL0HNUDAsGLyTH51rjU/edit?usp=sharing and project's Wiki page. Also see the Wiki for instructions on how to play the game.

# Obtaining the source

Pull the files from github. To play the game, simply run the executable. To run unit tests on the backend files, pull CatanApp and CatanTest to set up a solution space and run the provided Unit Tests.

# How to build

The project is dependent on Unity and C# but otherwise has no outside dependencies. To build the project, pull the CatanApp and CatanTest folders and set up a solution space in vscode (the folders should already be setup for this project and include the appropriate .sln file). Then, build the project and construct a main to interact with the back-end of the game. You can technically play it in this state, but you will manually need to input player turns and actions. To play the full game, simply run the Unity-based executable.
